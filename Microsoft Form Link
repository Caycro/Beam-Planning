Booking form for people accepted
https://forms.office.com/e/PUGPF0erEd
Proposal form:
https://forms.office.com/e/hgd2dwXzZq

With these forms someone can then click responses and then download an excel file containign the responses (can be maunally edited)
(should be done to assign a priority rank to each accepted proposal)
the excel file should then be saved as a CSV (must be done manually) in order to be used by the python app

the proposal form does not really fit into any of the app instead proposals should be evaluated by someone and then if sucessfuly the reviewer should send a link of the booking form to the accepted proposer
the reviewer should also give a priority rank (between 1 and 10 with larger number being better) in the excel for the second form (if no priority rank is assigned 1 should be automatically given)
