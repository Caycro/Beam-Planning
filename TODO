Python App: get the details in the CSV from the form and load them into a dictionary
should then create a new dictionary with the prioirty assigned and date submitted being replaced by a new field which represents the actual priority it should be determined by a calculation which has a positive (but not necessarilly linear) relationship with the time elapsed since form submission and the assigned priority by the admins

From there the app should do the following: order the dictionary by the actual priorioty
from there assign each person in the dictionary with the earliest days that are not yet used that both: the beam and the user are free and which are in the type their block requires
do this until either: everyone has been assigned a place
                      for none of the unassigned users there is a day avaliable
                      greater then the maximum % of avalible days has been assigned (these remaining days are avaliable for ad-hoc proposals)

after all days are assigned create a table in a calender format which shows wwhich days are booked and which are free
this can then be sent to others who may want to appoint someone
additonally a seperate table should be created for admins which allows for them to view who has booked each day
