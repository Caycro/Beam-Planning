# prototype
this is a prototype of the form made in C# (easy to make low quality frontend quickly with it)
it takes the results from the CSV which would be converted from the form's excel
and from there it will 
# ISSUES
  if user enters dates in wrong format progrm crashes
  does not provide options for wanting a certain % of spaces empty for adhoc
  does not allow for making holidays (so a day being treated as weekend or weekday is completly determined by what day of the week it is)
  does not provide options for certain days not being allowed to be used by machine 

# potential problems
  was made in windows in visual studio (not vs code) meaning in may not function properly on linux or mac
  calender UI is awful (just run it to find out but it looks ugly and doesnt convey the information well

# However
  despite these issues all that needs to be done (in terms of this part) is to make UI better and fix the issues mentioned
